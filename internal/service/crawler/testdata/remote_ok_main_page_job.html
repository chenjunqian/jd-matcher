                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    workflow productivity.\n\n\n\nAbout You\n* You take pride in our work and consistently deliver a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to

                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    <p dir="ltr">Hello, we‚Äôre Hippo. We‚Äôre the most successful startup you‚Äôve never heard of. We‚Äôve
                        saved 1.5 million Americans $631 million dollars on their medications since we were founded in
                        2017. We‚Äôre focused on making medications more affordable and convenient to purchase and we‚Äôre
                        giving consumers and their families the power to make better choices and lead healthier lives.
                        We are a product-forward company that knows how to execute quickly, build things right, and be

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    Scale, and Complex Application Development, with headquarters in McLean, VA. Our range of clients
                    includes innovative federal and public agencies leveraging design thinking, cutting-edge tech stack,
                    and cloud-native ecosystem. We build digital solutions that impact the lives of millions of

                    of critical events, including instances like the Chinese balloon and Cessna over the White House
                    incidents. Central to this data platform is the aggregation of real-time data from over 750 sensors.
                    This data is subsequently enriched, rendered queryable, and ultimately presented as a common
                    operational picture to empower operators in making time critical and pertinent decisions. Our system
                    efficiently handles the processing of over a billion events daily, all achieved with
                    millisecond-level latency. Key technologies include Kafka, Kafka Streams, Pinot, Java, Scala, and
                    Kubernetes. Your involvement in this role will encompass hands-on collaboration with a team of
                    accomplished individuals, collectively striving towards excellence. Your primary responsibilities

                    Excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail.\n\n Proven experience with modern software
                    development and engineering practices including scrum/agile, Git, and DevOps\n\nAbility to obtain a

                    customer-obsessed mentality. As we grow, and our footprint becomes larger, teams and employees will
                    treat each other not only as teammates but customers. We must live the customer-obsessed mindset,
                    always. This will help us scale and it will translate to the interactions that our Rafters have with
                    their clients and other product teams that they integrate with. Our culture will enable our success
                    and set us apart from other companies.\n\nHow do we get there?&nbsp;\n\nPublic-sector modernization
                    is critical for us to live in a better world. We, at Raft, want to innovate and solve complex
                    problems. And, if we are successful, our generation and the ones that follow us will live in a
                    delightful, efficient, and accessible world where out-of-box thinking,&nbsp;and collaboration is a
                    norm.&nbsp;\n\nRaft‚Äôs core philosophy is&nbsp;Ubuntu: I&nbsp;Am, Because&nbsp;We are. We support
                    our&nbsp;‚Äúnadi‚Äù&nbsp;by elevating the other Rafters. We work as a hyper collaborative team where
                    each team member brings a unique perspective, adding value that did not exist before. People make
                    Raft special. We celebrate each other and our cognitive and cultural diversity. We are devoted to
                    our practice of innovation and collaboration.&nbsp; \n\n#Salary and compensation\n

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to

                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    the employment market globally. Our mission is simple and clear. We‚Äôre empowering the people who do
                    essential work - from delivery drivers and warehouse workers, to cooks and cleaners - to get work
                    and get paid on their terms.&nbsp;\n\n\nWe match these people with companies we‚Äôve verified through
                    our powerful tech platform. Apps, AI, web-based tools, innovative matching solutions and more. We
                    create seriously smart technology, made for humans, by humans.&nbsp;\nAnd the numbers show we're
                    doing things right. 340,000 people got work with over 2,500 companies globally last year, with
                    clients spanning industries from logistics to retail, hospitality and more. We generated ‚Ç¨1.9
                    billion in revenue in 2022. And we‚Äôre grateful to our top tier investors at Atomico, Kinnevik and
                    Softbank.\n\n\nWe're headquartered in sunny Madrid, but we're a remote-first company operating in 10
                    countries across Europe, the United States and Latin America.\n\n\nBut there‚Äôs a missing piece.
                    You.\n\n\nJoin our community\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a company that values innovation, high
                    standards and data, you‚Äôve found it. We‚Äôre also good listeners, because everyone‚Äôs voice is heard at
                    Job&amp;Talent. These values help us make good decisions and keep momentum. That‚Äôs how we operate.
                    Standard.\n\n\nWhen it comes to our people, we‚Äôre all uniquely different. And it‚Äôs that difference
                    that makes us stronger.\n\n\nWe encourage everyone to bring their true selves to work. Being real
                    and empathic means we can build better products, services and workplaces for our workers and our
                    clients. And dare we say it, we think that makes us all happier humans.\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs in it for
                    you\n\n\nWe're building the world‚Äôs leading digital marketplace for essential work. You‚Äôll hear 10x
                    experience, AI, technology and human-centred design quite a lot. We strive for that across the
                    entire company, from finance, to supply, to product.\n\n\nMake an impact&nbsp;through extreme
                    ownership of the work you do. You create something and you help drive it forward. At Job&amp;Talent,
                    you‚Äôll make an impact across borders with cross-functional teams, wherever you are.\n\n\nBe
                    rewarded&nbsp;financially. It‚Äôs ingrained into our company philosophy. We offer our employees
                    competitive salaries and benefits. Our Talent team can tell you a lot more about the perks in your
                    region.\n\n\nGrow professionally&nbsp;by doing, not just watching or talking. We‚Äôre completely
                    hands-on and we‚Äôre bootstrappers, making the most of our resources. And don‚Äôt be surprised to find
                    yourself on a call with one of our founders. They like the details as much as the big
                    picture.\n\n\nProud to champion equality\n\n\nAt Job&amp;Talent we value diversity and we're an
                    Equal Opportunities employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified people regardless

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    the United States. This position is a part-time (3 hrs/week), remote position.\n\n\nWe have several
                    values that are very important to all team members:\n\n\nGrowth: We seek to be constantly learning
                    and growing both personally and professionally.&nbsp;\n\n\nRight Action: We strive to do the right
                    thing for colleagues and customers at all times.\n\n\nCulture of Belonging: We‚Äôre real. We‚Äôre

                    connections with each other as we go.\n\n\n If these values speak to you, you are excited about the
                    job description, and you meet the listed qualifications, we want to hear from you!\n\n\nAbout the
                    Position:\nTeacher Assistants provide valuable support to Program Leaders and Mentors at
                    Williamsburg Learning by assisting with meetings, substituting, and grading.&nbsp; Teacher
                    Assistants support the Program, including the Program Leader and Mentors in the program. Mentors are
                    ultimately responsible for ensuring that grading and communication align with Williamsburg Learning
                    guidelines.\n\n\n1) Agenda Management &amp; Meeting Scribe\n\n\nAttend recurring or ad hoc meetings
                    as requested by the Program Lead.\n\n\nCreate agendas, take notes, and complete follow-up action

                    lesson plans, and the course syllabus. They should review readings and topics for the class
                    session(s) and be prepared.\n\n\nA substitute should follow the lesson plan unless permission to
                    alter the plan is given by the administration.\n\n\nSubstitute Mentors engage students in meaningful
                    discussion using prepared lesson materials.&nbsp;\n\n\nThey should be familiar with the Rules of
                    Engagement, The Honor Code, and the basics of managing a classroom in either the physical
                    environment or the online environment.\n\n\nAfter the class has ended, a substitute provides a brief
                    but detailed report to the class mentor on what material was covered, what insights/issues were
                    raised, and shares any concerns or suggestions for moving forward.\n\n\nSubstitute Mentors fill in
                    for online Mentors during planned and unplanned absences from the virtual classroom. Substitute
                    Mentors have a familiarity with The Williamsburg Curriculum and The 6 Mentor Practices and are

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this
