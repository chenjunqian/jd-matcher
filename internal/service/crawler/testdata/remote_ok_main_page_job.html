                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay
                    to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to
                    do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are
                    also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company
                    in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and
                    see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                        style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply
                    above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this
                    site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay
                    to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to
                    do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are
                    also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company
                    in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and
                    see

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay
                    to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to
                    do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are
                    also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company
                    in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and
                    see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a
                        href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20"
                        style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply
                    above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this
                    site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon
                    information on there (external sites) or here.

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay

                    do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are
                    also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company

                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and
                    see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    <p>Please, pleasy-please, read and respect the following 5 notes before applying with a single
                        click:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Instead of using the RemoteOK built-in application system where the systems sends the
                            employer a note like "John is interested in this position, click here to see his
                            RemoteOK
                            CV" please just send your CV in <strong>PDF format</strong> to the following E-Mail
                            address:
                            jobs@lightupnet.de</li>
                        <li>We'll pay you 1500 EUR per month for 6h per day, Monday to Friday. It's hard to stay
                            focused
                            for 8 hours straight, therefore more than 6h per day don't make sense. You can have
                            other
                            jobs on the side, but not while you're dedicating your daily 6h to Lightup. The 6h must
                            get
                            spent dedicated, continous, without interruption and without doing other tasks at the
                            same
                            time.</li>
                        <li>You'll find a keyword at the end of this job description. Include it in your E-Mail to
                            us,
                            either in the subject or in the body of your E-Mail, so that we know you're clear about
                            what
                            you're actually applying for vs. just applying for a ton of jobs in a random fashion
                            because
                            that's not cool. E-Mails without the keyword will get ignored.</li>
                        <li>If there are should be typing or grammar mistakes in your CV we'll already know that you
                            don't pay much attention to detail and in this case you're the wrong candidate for this
                            job.
                        </li>
                        <li>Thanks for your cooperation, these are some prerequisites to save time on both sides.
                            :-)<br /></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Now, about the actual job: Lightup was established in 1998 in Frankfurt, Germany as a Hosting
                        &amp; Domain Provider and today is still a small but international Internet Full-Service
                        &amp;
                        Telephony Service Provider, focusing heavily on web-based telecommunication services (VoIP)
                        since 2011. We're need more developers to create more cool web telecom-related projects and
                        apps. 100% of our team works from remote.</p>
                    <p>To compensate for the monthly kind of low payment of just 1500 EUR, which may be too low for
                        some
                        parts of the world, we're offering you a quite unique profit sharing model: For every web
                        project that you turn into reality, you'll receive 20% of the profit that this project
                        generates
                        for as long as you stay with Lightup. That way, you'll be also extra motivated to extend the
                        service you just created and keep it running and improve it over time while it's growing,
                        generating you even more profit every month. We love to see our employees happy, and if the
                        company is profiting as a whole, you as an individual should profit from that, too.</p>
                    <p>We'll create the ideas, and you'll put these projects into reality. Your profile:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are awesome at working independently and self-sufficient, you are great at
                            researching
                            using Google and AI tools extensively to find the infos you need &amp; to learn.</li>
                        <li>You could, in theory, build functional websites from scratch without relying on AI or
                            programming tools.</li>
                        <li>You can write code from scratch using your brain, without AI, and just by using a text
                            editor (if need be).</li>
                        <li>Coding means actually writing manual code for you, not copy'ing &amp; paste'ing code
                            snippets that you found on the web. To you, coding also doesn't mean dragging objects
                            from A
                            to B in some visual "programming" tool.<br /></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In other words, you're a real programmer!</p>
                    <p>Your skills:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Perfect English &amp; typing proficiency. No typos, no grammar mistakes.</li>
                        <li>You can create Android apps from scratch, from start to finish, by yourself.</li>
                        <li>You can handle the Linux shell and you can navigate through a Linux-based filesystem
                            using
                            just command line tools.</li>
                        <li>You're a master of the programming language(s) of your choice that allow you to create
                            web-projects (PHP, Python, whatever).</li>
                        <li>You are very good at SQL, you understand the inner workings of e.g. MySQL and thus you
                            know
                            what makes queries slow and what makes them fast.<br /></li>
                        <li>All of this requires that you already have plenty of experience, if you are new to all
                            of
                            this or if you think AI will be able to handle these requirements for you, then you are
                            not
                            the right candidate.</li>
                        <li>You have used vi or vim before.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What the job will look like in practice:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We're defining the inner workings and features of the to-be-created web-based service,
                            or
                            app, together.</li>
                        <li>You'll start at 0 and build these services &amp; apps from the ground up, independently,
                            by
                            yourself.</li>
                        <li>We'll communicate permanently via Slack.</li>
                        <li>Here you can find the keyword so that we'll know you actually read until here:
                            Work-in-underpants.</li>
                        <li>No travelling required, you can do this job from anywhere in the world with a stable,
                            broadband internet connection. External keyboard + external mouse required in case
                            you're
                            working on a laptop, otherwise you would be too slow for what we expect from you.</li>
                        <li>We are a German company, and precision and speed are key to this role. :-)</li>
                    </ul>

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay
                    to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to
                    do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are
                    also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company
                    in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and
                    see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay
                    to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to
                    do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are
                    also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company
                    in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and
                    see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                        style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply
                    above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this

                    information on there (external sites) or here.

                    <p dir="ltr">We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it‚Äôs our intention to
                        continue
                        that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the
                        growth.</p>
                    <p><strong><br /></strong></p>
                    <p dir="ltr">--What is your company like?--</p>
                    <p dir="ltr">1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas,
                        on
                        your schedule. And we don‚Äôt care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and
                        catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we‚Äôre happy campers.</p>
                    <p><strong><br /></strong></p>
                    <p dir="ltr">2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you‚Äôre routinely working more than 45ish hours,
                        you‚Äôre gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which
                        means that you need to rest.</p>
                    <p><strong><br /></strong></p>
                    <p dir="ltr">3. You Can Be Yourself. You don‚Äôt have to put on a fake, professional face. You can
                        just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.</p>
                    <p><strong><br /></strong></p>
                    <p dir="ltr">4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small
                        business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote
                        quickly
                        once we identify talent. It doesn‚Äôt matter what your credentials are ‚Äì it matters what you
                        get
                        done.</p>
                    <p><strong><br /></strong></p>
                    <p dir="ltr">5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO
                        when
                        he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong><br /></strong></p>
                    <p dir="ltr">6. No Micro-Management. Once you‚Äôre trained and have demonstrated you know your
                        stuff,
                        we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and
                        motivated,
                        we probably aren‚Äôt the place for you.</p>
                    <p><strong><br /></strong></p>
                    <p dir="ltr">7. Supportive Environment. We don‚Äôt operate via intense stress or unreasonable
                        top-down
                        deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful ‚Äì internal politics are at a minimum here.

                    <p><strong><br /></strong></p>
                    <p dir="ltr">8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they
                        get
                        in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact
                        with
                        toxic people at work - how nice would that be?</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">9. We‚Äôll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
                        constantly.
                        You‚Äôll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every
                        day
                        to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your
                        life
                        easier.</p>
                    <p><strong><br /></strong></p>
                    <p dir="ltr">10. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off
                        is
                        absolutely worth it.</p>
                    <p><strong><br /></strong></p>
                    <p dir="ltr">11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What‚Äôs Right for Us. We don‚Äôt have to answer to anyone
                        but
                        ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs
                        trying
                        to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.</p>

                    <p><strong><br /></strong></p>
                    <p dir="ltr">For example, we have a ton of data, and storing tons of data in Google Sheets is

                        more
                        data and access it easily.</p>

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay
                    to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to
                    do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are
                    also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company
                    in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and
                    see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                        style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply
                    above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this
                    site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay
                    to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to
                    do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are
                    also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company
                    in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and
                    see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this

                        However, the current infrastructure often requires technical expertise, creating barriers
                        for
                        non-developer marketers.
                    </p>
                    <p>A significant challenge that marketers face is efficiently managing and validating wallet
                        addresses while collecting essential information such as feedback, shipping addresses, and
                        social media accounts. Currently, the process involves sending out traditional forms and
                        surveys, followed by the involvement of developers to extract, filter through fake
                        submissions
                        and bot entries, validate data from the blockchain, and finally, use a bespoke solution to
                        distribute rewards. This cumbersome process is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and
                        restricts
                        the speed and scale of marketing campaigns. We‚Äôre here to change that with DeForm.</p>
                    <p>DeForm is a crypto-native CRM that enables marketing using the new internet. Marketers use
                        DeForm
                        to ask personalized questions, understand an individual‚Äôs on-chain presence, and distribute
                        crypto rewards &amp; communications without developer intervention. Our team is building at
                        the
                        intersection of finance, community, and art ‚Äî redefining how audience and brand connections
                        are
                        unleashed and nurtured with the new internet.</p>

                    When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay
                    to
                    buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to
                    do.
                    Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are
                    also
                    scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company
                    in
                    the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and
                    see
                    if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a

                    above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this
